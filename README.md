# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Go!

Play the classic worldwide game that decides many life decisions right on your web browser with others! Rock, Paper, Scissors, Go! lets you play with strangers and friends with all the comfort of anonymity of the Internet. Play "for fun" matches where you can find random players, or host your own private lobby with a custom code you can share with others.

## Why Make This?

I had this idea to make rock paper scissors easily accessible and playable to anyone that wanted to play it. I wanted to make a game that anyone could play at anytime, anywhere, and on any device with a browser and internet. I wanted to make a game that you could play with friends or strangers *without* needing to make an account. In actuality, I wanted to play a game that I could play with my long distance friends that had easy set up and even easier gameplay.

One big reason is because I'm a big fighting game fan. In the Fighting Game Community (FGC), there's always talk of "RPS", or "rock, paper, scissors", when discussing guessing what your opponent will do. Just like in IRL RPS, you won't know what attack your opponent will do so you have to guess what will beat their move. Sometimes you win, lose, or have a draw! 

Another big reason is because I wanted to make a simple game. In college, I made two games for two different classes, Ticket to Ride as an Android class project, and online Blackjack where you try to beat the dealer. I wanted to take the skills I have now with React and Firebase, and do something that's simple and fun that everyone knows how to play. I also decided to learn Typescript at the same time!

## Why Firebase?

Firebase is a really nice "quick and easy" solution for a simple app like this. I used Firebase at my last job building a rideshare platform, and I really liked it! I like how easy it is to use the Authentication, Realtime Database, and its Hosting services. As of March 2024, this project is on the free tier so I don't have access to the Serverless backend functions, but those are also very useful to use. I chose Firebase so I didn't need to build a server, or use a hosting service that would have to build every single time it was accessed. With Firebase hosting and its direct access to the NoSQL database, this app is able to load quickly allow the user to get playing ASAP.
